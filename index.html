            <p>In the past year Steam has been working on a new handheld
                console called the Steam Deck. It was essentially a mini
                PC packaged with a battery in a Nintendo Switch like
                package. The OS running on it however was Steam's own
                custom fork of Arch Linux, meaning the games they plan
                to support on the device must support Linux in some
                fashion be it natively or via Proton. Proton is a sort
                of compatibility layer Steam has been working on for
                the last few years to allow the Windows version of games
                to run in linux. During that time, hundreds of games
                gained support for linux via Proton however the biggest
                offenders (while technically able to run) failed to run
                simply due to the anti-cheat software built in.
            </p>
            <p>In the past week however all that may have finally changed
                with the most popular anti-cheat software gaining support
                for Proton. To make things even better for linux gamers,
                all that is needed to enable support may be handled on
                the developers side where all it takes is for them to
                enable the option to support Proton in the anti-cheat
                software. Unfortunately though it would be on a per game
                basis and they changed would have to be released in a
                game update. Nonetheless it's a step in the right
                direction to bridge the gap between Windows and Linux
                gamers.

            <h2 class="post-title">Nvidia and Linux</h2>
            <p class="post-date-author">September 1, 2021 by Jason Hunter</p>
            <img id="img2" src="undraw_open_source_1qxw.png" alt="Image representing open source"/>
            <p>Over the course of this year Nvidia has made several
                improvements in their support for open source software
                as well as virtualization. Firstly Nvidia drivers now
                better support Wayland (a display server used to render
                the GUI of Linux based OSes). While there is still a
                long way to go before Wayland is completely stable on
                Nvidia GPUs, it is a step in the right direction
                considering all the effort in the Linux community
                going towards switching from Xorg to Wayland.
            </p>
            <p>Nvidia has also finally "fixed" code 43. For those who
                don't know what that is, this is an error code that
                their GPU drivers output when they detect that they are
                running in a virtual machine (VM). This ultimately
                prevented users from leveraging the full capabilities
                of their GPU in VMs. While there were several work arounds
                out there, they were all hit-or-miss. Now linux users
                with very little need for Windows outside of gaming,
                running CAD software or any other GPU intensive tasks
                have one less hurdle to passing their Nvidia GPUs through
                to a VM as opposed to dual booting.

            <p>I am a student at the University of the West Indies currently
                pursuing a double major in Electronics and Computer Science.
                My hobbies are playing computer games and learning about linux.
                I am not particularly interested in web development however
                I chose to do this course to improve my web development skills
                as that is my weakest area
